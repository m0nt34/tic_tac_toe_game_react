# advanced_tic_tac_toe_game_react

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (❌ or ⭕) on the board, aiming to align their symbols in a straight line — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The challenge increases with larger grids, requiring more strategy and foresight.
